# Task Deletion UI Update Issue

## Issue Description
When a task is deleted by clicking the delete button, the task is successfully removed from the backend/database, but the UI does not update immediately. The deleted task remains visible in the interface until the page is refreshed.

## Current Implementation
1. The task deletion is handled in `src/components/TaskList.js`
2. The component uses a combination of:
   - Local state management through `TaskContext`
   - API calls for authenticated users
   - LocalStorage for unauthenticated users

## Attempted Solutions
1. Added local state management with `localTasks` to maintain a copy of tasks
2. Implemented `useEffect` to sync local state with context state
3. Updated the deletion handler to update both local and context state
4. Created test cases to verify the functionality

## Current Status
- The issue persists despite the attempted solutions
- The task is successfully deleted from the backend
- The UI only updates after a page refresh
- Test cases are in place but may need revision

## Next Steps
1. Investigate the state management flow in more detail
2. Consider implementing a different state management approach
3. Review the component's lifecycle and update mechanisms
4. Consider using a state management library like Redux or Zustand
5. Add more comprehensive logging to track state changes

## Notes
- This issue might be related to React's state update batching
- The context state updates might not be triggering re-renders as expected
- The local state management might need a different approach
- Consider implementing a more robust state synchronization mechanism
