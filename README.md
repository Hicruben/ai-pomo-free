## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- Docker and Docker Compose (for MongoDB)

### Installation

#### 1. Start MongoDB with Docker Compose

```bash
# From the project root directory
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start:
- MongoDB on port 27017
- Mongo Express (web-based MongoDB admin interface) on port 8081

You can access Mongo Express at http://localhost:8081 with:
- Username: admin
- Password: password

The MongoDB connection details can be found and configured in `server/.env.production` after copying from `server/.env.example`.

#### 2. Start the Backend Server

```bash
# Navigate to the server directory
cd server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Initialize the database (first time only)
npm run init-db

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The server will run on http://localhost:5000.

#### 3. Start the Frontend Development Server

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd pomodoro-timer

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

The application will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

1. Set your preferred timer durations in the settings
2. Add tasks you want to work on
3. Select a task and start the timer
4. Work until the timer ends
5. Take a break when prompted
6. Repeat the process to boost your productivity

## Docker Commands

```bash
# Start containers
docker-compose up -d

# Stop containers
docker-compose down

# View logs
docker-compose logs

# Stop and remove containers, networks, and volumes
docker-compose down -v
```

## Environment Variables

### Backend Server

Create a `.env.production` file in the `server` directory by copying the example file:

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env.production
```

Then, edit `server/.env.production` to fill in your specific credentials and settings (e.g., MongoDB URI, JWT Secret, Google OAuth keys, email server details).

### Frontend Application

Create a `.env.production` file in the `pomodoro-timer` directory by copying the example file:

```bash
cp pomodoro-timer/.env.example pomodoro-timer/.env.production
```

The default `REACT_APP_API_URL=/api` should work if you are running the backend server on the same domain or using a proxy. If your backend is on a different URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5000` during local development when not using a proxy), update `pomodoro-timer/.env.production` accordingly:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### AI Features Setup (Optional)

To enable AI-powered project generation and task breakdown features:

1. Get a free API key from [DeepSeek](https://platform.deepseek.com/)
2. Add it to your frontend environment file:

```bash
# In pomodoro-timer/.env.production
REACT_APP_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here
```

**Note**: The AI features work entirely client-side for this open-source version. For production use, consider implementing a backend proxy to keep API keys secure.

## Deployment

### Production Build

1. **Build the frontend:**
```bash
cd pomodoro-timer
npm run build
```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Copy and configure `server/.env.example` to `server/.env.production`
   - Copy and configure `pomodoro-timer/.env.example` to `pomodoro-timer/.env.production`

3. **Start the production server:**
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

4. **Serve the frontend:**
   - Use a web server like Nginx to serve the built files from `pomodoro-timer/build/`
   - Configure reverse proxy to route API calls to your backend server

### Docker Deployment

Use the provided `docker-compose.yml` for easy deployment:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start MongoDB and you can then run the application servers.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note**: The default Docker configuration uses basic credentials (`admin`/`password`). For production deployments, make sure to:
1. Change the MongoDB credentials in `docker-compose.yml`
2. Update the corresponding credentials in `mongo-init.js`
3. Update your `MONGODB_URI` in the server environment configuration
