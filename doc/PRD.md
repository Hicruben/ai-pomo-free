## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for the Pomodoro Timer GTD System, an online productivity application that combines the Pomodoro Technique with Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology to help users manage their tasks, projects, and time effectively.

### 1.2 Scope
The Pomodoro Timer GTD System will provide users with tools to organize their work, life, and learning tasks as projects, track progress using the Pomodoro technique, and manage milestones and notes. The system will be accessible via web browsers and will include user authentication, data persistence, and basic analytics.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **Pomodoro Technique:** A time management method that uses timed intervals (traditionally 25 minutes) of focused work followed by short breaks.
- **GTD (Getting Things Done):** A productivity methodology created by David Allen that focuses on capturing, clarifying, organizing, and reviewing tasks.
- **Project:** A collection of related tasks, milestones, and notes with a common goal.
- **Task:** A specific action item that needs to be completed.
- **Milestone:** A significant point or event in a project's timeline.
- **Note:** A piece of information, idea, or inspiration related to a project.
- **Open Project:** A project that is currently active but not necessarily being worked on at the moment.
- **Working Project:** The single project that is currently being actively worked on.
- **Finished Project:** A project that has been completed.
